We highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us). We publish all received postcards on [our virtual postcard wall](https://spatie.be/open-source/postcards).

## Requirements

-   PHP 8.1 or higher
-   Laravel 10.x or 11.x
-   Node.js and npm/bun for frontend assets

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require hardimpactdev/liftoff-laravel
```

## Scaffolders

The package provides powerful scaffolding commands to quickly set up different aspects of your application. All scaffolders automatically generate routes using the route-maker package.

### Available Scaffolders

#### 1. App Scaffolder (Full Application Setup)

The most comprehensive scaffolder that sets up a complete application with authentication and CMS functionality.

```bash
php artisan liftoff:setup app
```

This scaffolder includes:

-   ✅ App class with redirect configuration
-   ✅ Dashboard controller and views
-   ✅ Settings pages (profile, password, appearance)
-   ✅ HandleInertiaRequests middleware
-   ✅ TypeScript type definitions
-   ✅ Feature tests
-   ✅ Full authentication system (runs Auth scaffolder)
-   ✅ Filament CMS integration (runs CMS scaffolder)
-   ✅ Automatic route generation

#### 2. Auth Scaffolder

Sets up a complete authentication system with login, registration, password reset, and email verification.

```bash
php artisan liftoff:setup auth
```

This scaffolder includes:

-   ✅ Authentication controllers with route attributes
-   ✅ Login request validation
-   ✅ Vue.js authentication pages
-   ✅ Authentication tests
-   ✅ User migration publishing

**Note:** The auth scaffolder requires the App class to be present. If running standalone, ensure you have an App class or run the app scaffolder instead.

#### 3. CMS Scaffolder

Sets up Filament CMS with user management and authentication.

```bash
php artisan liftoff:setup cms
```

This scaffolder includes:

-   ✅ App class with redirect configuration
-   ✅ Full authentication system (runs Auth scaffolder)
-   ✅ Filament package installation
-   ✅ User resource for managing users
-   ✅ Admin panel configuration
-   ✅ Filament CSS build process
-   ✅ Automatic route generation

### Route Generation

All scaffolders use the route-maker package to automatically generate routes from controller attributes. Routes are generated at the end of each scaffolding process, eliminating the need to manually run `php artisan route-maker:make`.

### Usage Examples

#### Quick Start - Full Application

```bash
# Install the package
composer require hardimpactdev/liftoff-laravel

# Run the app scaffolder for a complete setup
php artisan liftoff:setup app

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install # or bun install

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Start development server
npm run dev # or bun dev
```

#### Authentication Only

```bash
# Run just the auth scaffolder
php artisan liftoff:setup auth

# Note: Requires App class to be present
```

#### CMS with Authentication

```bash
# Run the CMS scaffolder (includes auth)
php artisan liftoff:setup cms

# Create a Filament user
php artisan make:filament-user
```

### Important Notes

1. **Middleware Replacement**: The HandleInertiaRequests middleware will be replaced if it already exists in your application.

2. **Route Attributes**: All controllers use route attributes from the route-maker package, eliminating the need for manual route definitions.

3. **App Class**: The App class provides a centralized location for application configuration, including login redirect routes.

4. **File Merging**: When copying directories, existing files are preserved unless they have the same name as files being copied.

5. **Dependencies**: Make sure to install the route-maker package if not already installed:
    ```bash
    composer require nckrtl/route-maker
    ```

## Testing
