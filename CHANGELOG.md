## v0.1.0 - Initial Release - 2026-01-07

### Initial Release

First tagged release of craft-laravel, the scaffolding companion package for craft-starterkit.

#### Features

- **Modular Setup System**: Run individual setups as needed
  - `craft:setup auth` - Add authentication
  - `craft:setup dashboard` - Add dashboard + settings pages
  - `craft:setup app` - Full app (auth + dashboard combined)
  - `craft:setup cms` - Add Filament CMS
  - `craft:setup multilanguage` - Add language files
  

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed namespace resolution in SetupCommand
- Fixed `scaffold()` → `setup()` method call in CMS auth task
- Renamed task file to match class name (RunSetupAuthTask)

#### Compatibility

- Aligned with craft-starterkit's current state
- Removed redundant vite i18n config tasks (already in starterkit)
- Added `language` field to User type stub
- SetupApp no longer forces CMS installation

#### Breaking Changes

- `craft:setup app` no longer includes CMS - run `craft:setup cms` separately if needed
